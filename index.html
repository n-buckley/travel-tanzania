                        After almost missing my connecting flight in Doha and 20 hours
                        of traveling (not counting my 20 hour layover in New York) I'd
                        finally arrived in Dar es Salaam.

                        After almost missing my connecting flight in Doha and 20 hours
                        of traveling (not counting my 20 hour layover in New York) I'd
                        finally arrived in Dar es Salaam.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first thing I did was explore the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in.
                        In the lobby there was a welcome table laid out with fresh coconuts,
                        upstairs there was an infinity pool, a 24 hour gym, free sauna and steam room
                        access, and a beautiful view of the sunset on the rooftop bar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Immediately after, I knocked out; I was exhausted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I woke up, I walked around with my roommate to find some food. Neither
                        of us were too hungry so we stopped for some street food bites. I learned my
                        first food in Kiswahili: <span class="swahili">chapati</span>, a flatbread. I'd be picking
                        up vocabulary during the whole trip. Fish is <span class="swahili">samaki</span>,
                        goat is <span class="swahili">nguzi</span>, chicken is <span class="swahili">kuku</span>
                        and my roommate and I learned what
                        <span class="swahili">ugali</span> was the hard way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next day we headed over
                        to a restaurant for lunch and before we left we asked out professor what he recommended
                        for vegetarians. He confidently recommended <span class="swahili">ugali</span>,
                        which he said was a kind of porridge; when I think of porridge, I think of soup or
                        oatmeal. So when my roommate ordered it and a big ball of dough was brought out
                        we were a little confused, we both assumed it would be like a dumpling, something with a
                        filling. It had no filling. We were bamboozled. I'm sure the restaurant staff was laughing at us
                        cutting up the <span class="swahili">ugali</span> with a fork and knife: stupid tourists
                        (you're supposed to use it to grab and eat your food). To note, while the vegetarians on the
                        trip
                        always got food they could eat, it was not always plentiful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short, learn some of the language before you travel to a new country. Some important terms
                        and
                        situations to know are several greeting phrases, please, thank you, you're welcome, basic
                        numbers, bartering phrases,
                        directional phrases, the name of your street, and some foods. Kiswahili is really easy to pick
                        up since
                        it's so phonetic and it will make your trip way better (and likely cheaper).

                        Part of our scheduling was a brief lecture about the history of Tanzania, a city tour, and a
                        visit to
                        Village Museum. I may add a history section later, after I read <span
                            class="swahili">Ujamaa</span> by Julius
                        Nyerere. The Village Museum was an experience. They showed us examples of housing that different
                        native nomadic tribes build and informed us of some (likely false) burial practices and how
                        conflicts are
                        resolved by consensus between parties or by elder judgment. At the end there was a traditional
                        dance that
                        all of the students were eventually pulled into.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next day classes started -- it was more of a conference where different people presented
                        their
                        research on the impacts of climate change (in general and specifically to Tanzania), some
                        proposed
                        solutions, and future research projects. It was an incredibly long day sitting for hours and
                        sometimes,
                        since some of the research was really technical, indecipherable terms would go in one ear and
                        out
                        the other. Some of it was really interesting mainly, I thought, the stuff about flooding, costal
                        resilience, and how it would affect impoverished areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think enough people complained about the super long day enough, that it seemed we were
                        sticking to the
                        time schedule way better. Throughout the trip we visited COSTECH and the TMA (the latter of
                        which was my
                        favorite), had a couple more guest lecturers, and a lot of time dedicated to working on our
                        projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We were split up into teams, and the goal was to have a parliamentary budget meeting, where all
                        teams
                        would debate the importance, and thus budgetary allowance, of their goals and needs. The teams
                        were
                        split up into different government sectors such as
                        infrastructure, services, tourism, industry, and agriculture. I think the goal was a bit too
                        lofty; not only
                        for us to become fully knowledgable in our sectors (given the breadth of each), but also
                        to learn realistic budget expansions <i>and</i> which budget to advocate cuts from (which would
                        imply needing to
                        know enough about the other sectors as well). Overall, I enjoyed the experience even though it
                        was a bit inconclusive.
                        We also sang karaoke after. We introduced the Tanzanians to some classic white people songs.

                        On our off time, we went Tanzanite shopping (which I recommend doing in Dar, it's way cheaper),
                        shopping in general at local markets, swimming in the hotel pool, and to visit the beach and
                        tourist towns of the northern part of
                        Dar es Salaam (Oyster Bay, Coco Beach, and Masaki). We really liked the restaurant/bar <span
                            class="swahili">Samaki Samaki</span>, Fish and More.
                        The night we went, there was karaoke, and we were going to go up to only realize that the
                        kareoke singers were <i>belting</i>
                        Celine Dion, and hitting all the notes.

                        To get there you have to take some kind of transportation. Taxi is the safest, but most
                        expensive. You also have the
                        option to take <span class="swahili">boda bodas</span>, motocycle taxis, or <span
                            class="swahili">tuk tuks</span> (or <span class="swahili">bajajs</span>),
                        a motorized rickshaw. We mostly used the latter after learning we could cram 5 people into them
                        for pretty cheap.
                        You can also take <span class="swahili">dala dalas</span>, minibuses, but we never figured out
                        how those worked.

                        So to get to Zanzibar from Dar es Salaam you can fly or take the ferry like we did.
                        Unfortunately, I fell asleep on the ferry
                        but it's supposedly a very pretty trip. We had a very chaotic arrival in Zanzibar since you have
                        to go through something like
                        immigration (even though it's a domestic trip). Afterwards, we got on buses and drove along the
                        entire west coast of the island to
                        arrive to our hotel.
                    </p>
                    <!-- edit the first sentence not the ✨vibe-->
                    <p>
                        Entering the hotel was magical, we walked through a vibrant green foliage-covered pathway and
                        then the view opened up to a beach bungalow sitting
                        on a beautiful sprawling white sand beach. Some daily activities were talking walks or bike
                        rides along the beach, playing soccer with locals, and
                        kayaking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The magic wore off on me after a day or two: nested away started to feel more like isolated.
                        Don't get me wrong, the hotel and location was still beautiful and
                        I woke up every morning for the sun to rise over the water, had a yummy breakfast, and then went
                        kayaking. But the island is pretty big, definitely not something you
                        could walk around in a day (unlike some tour guide had previously mentioned). Pretty much the
                        only place we could be was the hotel, and maybe its because I'm
                        from Florida, but there's only so much you can do at the beach. It also just wasn't nearly as
                        cheap as Dar to get around, so it's not like we could just
                        leave ($100 for an hour taxi).

                        Fortunately there were some excursions included in the trip and we headed to Stone Town, which I
                        loved and would have gotten lost in if not for the guides. It's a
                        labyrinth of alleyways still decorated with a lot of the old Arab and Indian architecture. We
                        spent the day walking around listening to the tour guide
                        explaining how to notice different patterns in the historic doors. We had a bit of free time and
                        bought some more souvenirs, but all in all Dar was the cheapest
                        place to do so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later we went to Jozani Forest wandering through mangrove forests and later a jungle where we
                        got to see some cute monkeys and huge trees.
                        I wish the guava had been in season so we could have gotten to try some, I miss my guava tree.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another day, we had a free day, and I could have opted to stay at the hotel, but obviously I
                        didn't do that. We arranged a (pretty expensive) taxi
                        to pick us up and take us to Nungwi Beach as three of us had arranged to go horseback riding in
                        the ocean. That same day, another
                        group had arranged to go on a spice tour (where they got to buy locally made perfume oils 😭).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While we thought the beach our hotel was on was pretty, Nungwi beach was gorgeous. The water was
                        so blue and <i>so </i> clear and best of
                        all there were people and businesses. Anyhow, my friends and I went to get our horses, we
                        assured the lady that we had all ridden horses before (we had
                        not), and made our way out into the water. I was pretty surprised that we were riding bareback
                        butt we got on the horses anyway and it was pretty damn hard
                        to balance and lead the horse in the water. At one point, I must've done something or my horse,
                        <span class="swahili">Safari</span>, just got spooked
                        and it started sprinting. I squeezed my legs as hard as possible and leaned forward, and while I
                        was scared I wasn't going to be able to stay on, that
                        was definitely the highlight of my experience (also <span class="swahili">Safari</span> just
                        pooped in the water while he was walking, that was also an experience).

                    <p>
                        We hung out at the beach a little while longer, explored a little bit, and bought some
                        souvenirs. We called the taxi back to take us to Mnarani
                        Turtle Conservatory, a natural spring where some native turtles are kept for conservation
                        efforts. We got in the water with turtles of all sizes and some small fish, occasionally
                        employees would throw in some kelp for the turtles and all the turtles would swarm the area. We
                        eventually had to leave because we had to get back to the hotel for a lecture
                        on network theory and transportation system vulnerability to flooding. There was also an effort
                        to do a coding demonstration but none of us had working wifi, so it didn't really work out.

                    <p>
                        All in all, it was a good day - but tragedy stuck the next. The previous night Aidan had a 103
                        degree fever (reportedly 106), which freaked me out a lot and I think I went to bed early.
                        I woke up really achey, and kind of chalked it up to the horseback riding and went to breakfast.
                        About half the group was going snorkeling
                        that day but I decided to stay at the hotel and explore the village. I really wasn't feeling
                        good after breakfast so I got back in bed, planning to wake up in an hour.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I did not wake up an hour later. When I woke up and it was light out, I thought I had slept
                        until the next morning - it had been 30 minutes. Enough said that I did not get to explore the
                        village.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had developed an 103 degree fever and was in and out of sleep all day. I had a cooling towel
                        with ice that I'd placed behind my neck and on my head to try around
                        cool myself down, but my fever just wasn't breaking. There was also a covid scare going around
                        so everyone was taking tests. I took and ibuprofen and later when that did nothing
                        I took a Tylenol. Finally, my fever broke around 6pm and I was covid negative. Apparently all
                        day, people were having stomach issues and I started to have some too after my
                        fever broke. I think about half of us ended up with food poisoning and we're still not really
                        sure from where...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next day we had to leave. While I can't say that Zanzibar was my favorite experience of all
                        the places we went, I think that the circumstances
                        that I was there under, didn't lead to the best experience for me. I would definitely go back
                        and maybe next time stay in a more populated area,
                        like Stone Town or Nungwi, and learn how to ride the <span class="swahili">dala dalas</span>
                        which are the cheapest way to get around Zanzibar. Like I said,
                        its such a big island, and I'd love to explore it some more.

                        Off to Arusha! We took a quick plane ride and arrive at our hotel. I still wasn't feeling
                        great so I wasn't doing much and I definitely wasn't taking pictures, so I have very few
                        pictures of Arusha.

                        We were supposed to be doing our second war games here but instead of representing national
                        sectors,
                        teams represented different national bodies and interests: such as the IMF, the UN, Tanzanian
                        import
                        partners, export partners, and Tanzania. Instead of debating on budget, we debate on fair
                        and equitable policies for development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think this project was way better scoped which led to better debates. The only thing was that
                        people would get confused on what was being debated. Again this happened because if A and B are
                        debating
                        and A wants x and B wants y, then A also has to be knowledgable on y and how itself and vise
                        versa.
                        I think the Dialogue could have benefited from more general lectures, such as on various climate
                        policy solutions
                        (e.g. carbon tax, carbon credits, etc).

                        during the day, and going to a new hotel almost every night.

                        and Godwin, we saw some rare twin baby elephants and got to see four of the Big 5 (unless you
                        count hardly seeing rhinos through
                        binoculars, then we saw all five). We went to ___, __, __ (list all of the parks). It was also
                        peak season, so we got to see parts of the
                        great migration.

                        The hotels we stayed at were so nice. They would greet us with some small welcome drink, usually
                        iced tea or fruit juice, and they
                        were beautifully located. Surprisingly, I never had the feeling that I had in Zanzibar, of being
                        isolated, even though
                        we were literally in the middle of nowhere. I think it was because we were never at the hotels
                        for long enough for me to get antsy.

                        While at the hotels we'd hang out by the pool or fireplace if they had one.
                        Or find various rocks to climb. There was one rock that several people had climbed up that I
                        couldn't figure
                        out how to get up, and I was scared of how I'd get down. Eventually I found a foothold I could
                        reach and was
                        able to get up and came back down the same way. </div>

                        Our last assignment while we were on the trip was to read an assigned book and give a book
                        report to the class. My book
                        was Rethinking AI, read my thoughts <a

                        For all of these you want to make sure either your driver knows where you want to go
                        or you have a map to give them directions. If you are doing the latter, know some words
                        in Kiswahili such as left, right, straight and stop here.
                    </p>
                    <p class="emphasis large-line-height">Taxi</p>
                    <p>
                        You can usually find taxis waiting outside hotels or you can have your hotel arrange a taxi for
                        you.
                        We did both on this trip and it was substantially cheaper when we went to just find a taxi.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another tip is that the taxis that you find away from hotels will also be cheaper. You wont get
                        local prices/rates
                        but they won't be able to up-charge you based on your hotel.
                        Also if there's a taxi driver that you has a good rate, get
                        their WhatsApp and they might be able to come to you when you need it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For us, a 20-30 minute taxi was about 15,000 shillings, or $8.
                    </p>
                    <p class="emphasis large-line-height">Tuk Tuk</p>
                    <p>
                        This is mostly how we got around because it was cheaper and way more fun.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One night we were walking back
                        and though we'd be able to find taxis down the road. We were walking for a while and didn't see
                        any taxis and any <span class="swhili">tuk tuks</span> we did see were alone and we didn't think
                        we'd all fit.
                        Eventually we had to ask because we had kept walking and still not seen anything. The driver
                        said it was alright
                        and the five of us squeezed in. Luckily the driver knew the area we wanted to get to,
                        unfortunately I didn't know how to say
                        stop when we got to the hotel, but I did know how to say slow "pole pole", so he slowed down
                        enough for us just to step
                        out and then he realized he had to stop. That was a 7,000 shilling, or $5, ride.

                    <p>
                        To find these you also need to be in a pretty busy area since they usually hang around high
                        traffic areas.
                        You can also flag them down. Sometimes when they're driving along the road they honk at you, and
                        I could never figure out
                        they were asking if you wanted a ride of if they were catcalling. I assumed the former and would
                        just respond no.

                    <p>
                        Only got to ride these a couple times but they're also pretty fun. Actually I was riding one
                        with a friend, and he didn't
                        feel safe sitting on the back so he sat in the middle with me on the end (with the driver in
                        front of course). Throughout our
                        whole ride we would find locals laughing at us, I thought that was funny.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We could not figure out how to flag these down. The only time we were able to find
                        some where in high traffic areas or hanging around gas stations.

                        A 10 minute drive was about 2,000 shillings, or $1, by far the cheapest transportation
                        I took while in Tanzania.

                    <p>
                        I really wish I had figure out how these worked. They're always packed like sardines, but some
                        that I saw
                        looked pretty cool with colorful LED lighting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All the reading I've done says that these are so cheap.
                        I recommend finding more information on them, but someone took a <span class="swahili">dala
                            dala</span> from Stone Town
                        to the other side of Zanzibar for 2,000 shillings. If we had gotten a <i>taxi </i> for that
                        distance, it would have been
                        like $60 for 4 people. They payed one dollar, one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ones I saw in the city, the drivers that were collecting payment were collecting coins. The
                        largest coin that exists
                        is 500 shillings, I think, which is 50 cents per person.

                    <p>
                        Also "real", government-operated, buses also exist and run in major cities. I saw the bus stops,
                        but I hardly saw a bus.
                        Maybe because I wasn't really looking for them, but I'm not sure how often they come.

                        I'm a small person, and I felt perfectly safe everywhere I went while in Tanzania.
                        I wouldn't walk around alone, but I wouldn't walk around alone in any city I'm unfamiliar with.

                        Its important to have common sense, know how to say 'no', or <span
                            class="swahili">hapana</span>, when locals approach you and offer to sell you stuff or
                        follow you around, and also
                        be able to ignore them in general.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have to say I'm definitely more cynical than some others on the group, I always thought
                        the locals were trying to scam us (its typical to follow you to your destination then ask for
                        payment since they were "protecting" or "guiding" you). But, some
                        people engaged more with locals that approached them and had a really good time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For women, the men will catcall and verbally harass you but I was
                        never physically approached (I was also never alone, I'm not sure if this would be different).
                        I also felt safe when it was just me and my female roommate, so you don't necessarily
                        need to be with a guy. I was proposed to a couple times on the street and told that they loved
                        me - that was funny. Most of it is pretty harmless, you just need to tune it out.

                        I was there for a month and all my stuff fit into a cary-on and a backpack.
                        I really can't think of anything that I was missing, or at least nothing obvious.
                        Oh, actually, a clothing line and a small zipped purse/bad would have been nice.

                    <p>
                        In terms of clothes, a lot that I'd read said that since the areas I was traveling to
                        were religious you should dress conservatively. I don't own a lot of conservative
                        and really it wasn't that important. Yes, was I catcalled on the street, but that would have
                        happened regardless of what I was wearing, especially since I'm obviously a foreigner (read:
                        white).

                        I'm a big researcher when I travel, I don't really like being idle. I usually
                        make itineraries, but that was kind of impossible on this trip since we hardly followed
                        our class itinerary... It was more of a go with the flow trip. Anyway, here's my
                        research of all the cool places to go.
