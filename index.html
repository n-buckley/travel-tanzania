                            After almost  missing my connecting flight in Doha and 20 hours 
                            of traveling (not counting my 20 hour layover in New York) I'd

                            After almost missing my connecting flight in Doha and 20 hours 
                            of traveling (not counting my 20 hour layover in New York) I'd 
                            finally arrived in Dar es Salaam. 
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            The first thing I did was explore the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. 
                            In the lobby there was a welcome table laid out with fresh coconuts, 
                            upstairs there was an infinity pool, a 24 hour gym, free sauna and steam room 
                            access, and a beautiful view of the sunset on the rooftop bar.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Immediately after, I knocked out; I was exhausted. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I woke up, I walked around with my roommate to find some food. Neither 
                            of us were too hungry so we stopped for some street food bites. I learned my 
                            first food in Kiswahili: <span class="swahili">chapati</span>, a flatbread. I'd be picking 
                            up vocabulary during the whole trip. Fish is <span class="swahili">samaki</span>, 
                            goat is <span class="swahili">nguzi</span>, chicken is <span class="swahili">kuku</span> 
                            and my roommate and I learned what 
                            <span class="swahili">ugali</span> was the hard way. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next day we headed over 
                            to a restaurant for lunch and before we left we asked out professor what he recommended 
                            for vegetarians. He confidently recommended <span class="swahili">ugali</span>, 
                            which he said was a kind of porridge; when I think of porridge, I think of soup or 
                            oatmeal. So when my roommate ordered it and a big ball of dough was brought out 
                            we were a little confused, we both assumed it would be like a dumpling, something with a 
                            filling. It had no filling. We were bamboozled. I'm sure the restaurant staff was laughing at us
                            cutting up the <span class="swahili">ugali</span> with a fork and knife: stupid tourists
                            (you're supposed to use it to grab and eat your food). To note, while the vegetarians on the trip
                            always got food they could eat, it was not always plentiful.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In short, learn some of the language before you travel to a new country. Some important terms and 
                            situations to know are several greeting phrases, please, thank you, you're welcome, basic numbers, bartering phrases, 
                            directional phrases, the name of your street, and some foods. Kiswahili is really easy to pick up since 
                            it's so phonetic and it will make your trip way better (and likely cheaper).

                            Part of our scheduling was a brief lecture about the history of Tanzania, a city tour, and a visit to 
                            Village Museum. I  may add a history section later, after I read <span class="swahili">Ujamaa</span> by Julius 
                            Nyerere. The Village Museum was an experience. They showed us examples of housing that different 
                            native nomadic tribes build and informed us of some (likely false) burial practices and how conflicts are 
                            resolved by consensus between parties or by elder judgment. At the end there was a traditional dance that 
                            all of the students were eventually pulled into.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next day classes started -- it was more of a conference where different people presented their 
                            research on the impacts of climate change (in general and specifically to Tanzania), some proposed 
                            solutions, and future research projects. It was an incredibly long day sitting for hours and sometimes,
                            since some of the research was really technical, indecipherable terms would go in one ear and out 
                            the other. Some of it was really interesting mainly, I thought, the stuff about flooding, costal 
                            resilience, and how it would affect impoverished areas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think enough people complained about the super long day enough, that it seemed we were sticking to the 
                            time schedule way better. Throughout the trip we visited COSTECH and the TMA (the latter of which was my 
                            favorite), had a couple more guest lecturers, and a lot of time dedicated to working on our projects.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We were split up into teams, and the goal was to have a parliamentary budget meeting, where all teams 
                            would debate the importance, and thus budgetary allowance, of their goals and needs. The teams were 
                            split up into different government sectors such as 
                            infrastructure, services, tourism, industry, and agriculture. I think the goal was a bit too lofty; not only
                            for us to become fully knowledgable in our sectors (given the breadth of each), but also
                            to learn realistic budget expansions <i>and</i> which budget to advocate cuts from (which would imply needing to
                            know enough about the other sectors as well). Overall, I enjoyed the experience even though it was a bit inconclusive. 
                            We also sang karaoke after. We introduced the Tanzanians to some classic white people songs.

                            On our off time, we went Tanzanite shopping (which I recommend doing in Dar, it's way cheaper), 
                            shopping in general at local markets, swimming in the hotel pool, and to visit the beach and tourist towns of the northern part of 
                            Dar es Salaam (Oyster Bay, Coco Beach, and Masaki). We really liked the restaurant/bar <span class="swahili">Samaki Samaki</span>, Fish and More. 
                            The night we went, there was kareoke, and we were going to go up to only realize that the kareoke singers were <i>belting</i>
                            Celine Dion, and hitting all the notes.

                            To get there you have to take some kind of transportation. Taxi is the safest, but most expensive. You also have the 
                            option to take <span class="swahili">boda bodas</span>, motocycle taxis, or <span class="swahili">tuk tuks</span> (or <span class="swahili">bajajs</span>), 
                            a motorized rickshaw. We mostly used the latter after learning we could cram 5 people into them for pretty cheap.
                            You can also take <span class="swahili">dala dalas</span>, minibuses, but we never figured out how those worked.
