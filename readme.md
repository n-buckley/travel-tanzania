## HTML/CSS Project 

This project is inspired by Scrimba's [HTML/CSS course](https://scrimba.com/learn/htmlandcss).

I already knew HTML/CSS but, besides the fact that I am constantly questioning my skills, I wanted to see if I was missing anything by not learning it "formally". I went through the whole course in about 4-5 hours including participating in some of the challeneges to test my memory and improve my typing skills. Everything covered was something I had previously used, but I did happily learn some things about [centering items](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/114543/how-to-horizontally-center-an-element/46449757#:~:text=If%20the%20element%20is%20a,element%20to%20the%20centre%20horizontally.) and flexbox. 

I'd always kinda just played around with ```display: block``` and ```display:inline``` until it looked like how I wanted, but never really knew why somethings worked or didn't. I mean obviously it wasn't necessay to know, per se, since I eventually figured it out, but this will hopfully make things faster for me. 

* If you are using the ```margin:auto``` way to center things, then this assumes your item is a ```block``` type and has a fixed ```width``` [^1]
* Now some flexbox properties [^2]

```display:flex;``` Puts items in one row. Can also be inline or block  
```flex-direction: column; ```Default is row. Puts all items in one column.  

The below properties change based on flex-direction. If row then horizontally, vertically respectivley. Vise versa if column.  

```justify-content: center; ``` Centers the item horizontally. Can also be start, end, space-between, space-around   
```align-items: center; ``` Aligns an item vertically. 
						Default is stretch (will make the item take up the whole vertical space of its container). 

All in all, I think the course is good (I actually really like the platform) and am definitley considering taking other courses and its **free!!**

# Project Goal

The **final project** for this course is to make a site advertising your hometown. I don't particularly care about my hometown but I would love to travel more. I also have a bit more experience, maybe, than someone who typically completes the course and I want to challenge myself a little. 

Currently I have two ideas:
* Make a site advertising somewhere I want to go (e.g. Peru, Colombia) and 
* Make a site documenting my Trip to Tanzania

I'm kind of leaning towards the latter at the moment because I think it would be fun to recount and, also, my professor wanted something like this so he could advertise the trip to interested students (it was an abroad semester).

I love reading travel blogs and here are some that I like:
[Peru - Salt in our Hair](https://www.saltinourhair.com/peru/), [Peru - A Blonde Abroad](https://www.theblondeabroad.com/ultimate-peru-travel-guide/), [Peru - Along Dusty Roads](https://www.alongdustyroads.com/peru), and [Peru - Nomadic Matt](https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/peru-travel-tips/) (if you can't tell, I'd really like to go to Peru).

I also want to document this experience, I tend to be very forgetful. I can't remeber projects I worked on for class from under a year ago -- at all. Of course, if I go back and I look at the code, I'll get flashback to working on it and the people I worked on it with, but I can't remeber specifics. When I talk about these projects, or put them on my resume, I just look silly or like I didn't do what I said I did, which isn't the case at all (very long hours on those projects let me tell you). 

Everyday that I work on this, I'm going to document my **goal for the day, anything I got stuck on, and if I finished the goal**. If I finish the goal, then I'll iterate. I also tend to get analysis paralysis, so I'll document any of that too.

Update: I've realized that I had already named the repo travel-tanzania so I suppose I've made my choice

## day by day

### Jul 11, 2022

I [picked out](https://www.figma.com/file/Amzww2cEqJLnrUdIniNzjS/travel-tanzania?node-id=0%3A1) differnt features I liked from the inspo and so it's time to start... woo

So... I didn't really set a goal... but I did the hero banner thing. I'm just doing a simple one: a background image and a title. 

> Eventually I'd like to be able to do the shape masks like the Salt in our Hair blog

 but that's a little out of my scope right now.
