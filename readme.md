### HTML/CSS Project 

This project is inspired by Scrimba's [HTML/CSS course](https://scrimba.com/learn/htmlandcss).

I already knew HTML/CSS but, besides the fact that I am constantly questioning my skills, I wanted to see if I was missing anything by not learning it "formally". I went through the whole course in about 4-5 hours including participating in some of the challenges to test my memory and improve my typing skills. Everything covered was something I had previously used, but I did happily learn some things about [centering items](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/114543/how-to-horizontally-center-an-element/46449757#:~:text=If%20the%20element%20is%20a,element%20to%20the%20centre%20horizontally.) and flexbox. 

I'd always kinda just played around with ```display: block``` and ```display:inline``` until it looked like how I wanted, but never really knew why somethings worked or didn't. I mean obviously it wasn't necessary to know, per se, since I eventually figured it out, but this will hopefully make things faster for me. 

* If you are using the ```margin:auto``` way to center things, then this assumes your item is a ```block``` type and has a fixed ```width``` [^1]
* Now some flexbox properties [^2]

```display:flex;``` Puts items in one row. Can also be inline or block  
```flex-direction: column; ```Default is row. Puts all items in one column.  

The below properties change based on flex-direction. If row then horizontally, vertically respectively. Vise versa if column.  

```justify-content: center; ``` Centers the item horizontally. Can also be start, end, space-between, space-around   
```align-items: center; ``` Aligns an item vertically. 
						Default is stretch (will make the item take up the whole vertical space of its container). 

All in all, I think the course is good (I actually really like the platform) and am definitely considering taking other courses and its **free!!**

# Project Goal

The **final project** for this course is to make a site advertising your hometown. I don't particularly care about my hometown but I would love to travel more. I also want to challenge myself a little. 

Currently I have two ideas:
* Make a site advertising somewhere I want to go (e.g. Peru, Colombia) and 
* Make a site documenting my Trip to Tanzania

I'm kind of leaning towards the latter at the moment because I think it would be fun to recount and, also, my professor wanted something like this so he could advertise the trip to interested students (it was an abroad semester).

I love reading travel blogs and here are some that I like:
[Peru - Salt in our Hair](https://www.saltinourhair.com/peru/), [Peru - A Blonde Abroad](https://www.theblondeabroad.com/ultimate-peru-travel-guide/), [Peru - Along Dusty Roads](https://www.alongdustyroads.com/peru), and [Peru - Nomadic Matt](https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/peru-travel-tips/) (if you can't tell, I'd really like to go to Peru).

I also want to document this experience, I tend to be very forgetful. I can't remember projects I worked on for class from under a year ago -- at all. Of course, if I go back and I look at the code, I'll get flashback to working on it and the people I worked on it with, but I can't remember specifics. When I talk about these projects, or put them on my resume, I just look silly or like I didn't do what I said I did, which isn't the case at all (very long hours on those projects let me tell you). 

Everyday that I work on this, I'm going to document my **goal for the day, anything I got stuck on, and if I finished the goal**. If I finish the goal, then I'll iterate. I also tend to get analysis paralysis, so I'll document any of that too.

Update: I've realized that I had already named the repo travel-tanzania so I suppose I've made my choice

## day by day

### Jul 11, 2022

I [picked out](https://www.figma.com/file/Amzww2cEqJLnrUdIniNzjS/travel-tanzania?node-id=0%3A1) different features I liked from the inspo and so it's time to start... woo

So... I didn't really set a goal... but I did the hero banner thing. I'm just doing a simple one: a background image and a title. 

- [ ] Eventually I'd like to be able to do the shape masks like the Salt in our Hair blog

 but that's a little out of my scope right now. 



This next section I'm not really sure what I want to put in it or how I want to arrange it.

I would like to have   
- [x] A **table of contents** since I predict this is going to be a pretty long page  
- [ ] I want the little **interactive world map**,   
- [x]  **My itinerary**  
- [x]  Maybe like a **list of different regions** in TZ. 

but thats a bit much for one screen I think. Oh! idea 

- [ ]  The interactive world map could be a map of Tanzania separated by region, each region could be highlighted.  
- [ ] I think I would have to make my own SVG of Tanzania + its regions (i doubt it already exists)
    - [ ] OR I don't need to  separate by region, just have a PIN that shows up when you hover...

Ok I'm trying to just get a picture of a map to look like a polaroid and I don't know how to get it so that the border proportionally scales with the size of the map. 

- [ ] look up how to make a polaroid in css?
-- I actually decided I dont want to do thi

Alright I blocked out the content for the second page. 

- [ ] Make the flex box better responsive for smaller screens. Maybe ```flex-dir: column``` if screen too small?

Good lord, every time I work with flex boxes I get this problem. Theres left/right scrolling because it overflows and I never remember how I fix it. ðŸ˜‘  
-- Oh, oops I got it I just had a weird margin somewhere.

- [ ] Ew the pins are ugly. Get some icon to replace that rip

Ok... she's kinda ugly, honestly the only thing **really** bothering me is the map. Its a bit crammed I think...

- [x] Un-cram map
- [ ] Write the overview paragraphs ...
- [x] learn how to put elements on top of each other? (e.g. the list of regions on top of map)  
-- ðŸ˜¯ You can have ```negative margins```!! Is this the best way to do it? Ok now how do I bring to front... Ok to do **stacking** you have to use ```z-index``` and specify the ```position: relative```
- [x] Small irritation either Kilimanjaro shouldn't be underlined

I'm actually fairly happy with how it looks right now. I mean its not the prettiest, but its pretty good? 

- [ ] Eventually make all of the list stuff clickable anchors

Should I be linking pictures of my updates ? TBD

Ok my next **goal** is literally just to type, I wish VS Code had spell check ðŸ˜© (just installed one). I remember when I was working with react I could just type in a "data" page or something and then import but I'm not sure if this is possible with just HTML/CSS ?

- [ ] I'd like to have my color theme be variables in case i want to change it i don't have to manually change it everywhere

- [ ] I can't figure out how to get text on the baseline for the top things to do
- [ ] Eventually animate the cards to flip

Its technically the next day, but I haven't pushed yesterdays changes yet. 

Pictures to include (Dar)
- [x] rooftop bar sunset picture
- [x] city picture
- [x] village museum
- [x] ugali
- [x] war games 1
- [x] tuk tuk picture

### Jul 12, 2022

I need to commit to git more. What is standard ? I tend to only commit when I finish a page/would be ready to push...

Alright todays goal is:
> import the pictures you need for Dar (and formatting) [done!]

> iv decided that I want the locations to alternate alignment (Dar: left, Z: right, A: left) and every other section on the left so fix that formatting 
-- actually i lied, I don't mind them all being the same

- [ ] Add a scroll to top button that directs to table of contents

Pictures for Zanzibar:
- [x]  of the hotel 
- [x] (maybe a sunset/rise picture)
- [x] stone town architecture
- [x] jozani forest 
- [x] horses
- [x] turtles

Time for Arusha + National Parks Content. Writing takes so long ;-; and I need to go back and edit because i'm sure some things are wrong. 

At this point this has become more of a writing challenge than an HTML/CSS challenge...


I suppose once I finish the content I can go back and spruce it up? I do have things marked that I want to do... We'll see

- [ ] add carousel for each region of cool places
- [ ] add list of everything you packed? a
    - [ ] a cute like animated backpack would be adorable like you hover and it shows 
- [ ] the about page/content (i hat writing about myself !!!)
- [ ] add a footer with socials and idk what else is usually in the footer?

 Next goal? Check off all the things I haven't done yet ! Lol ok 

 realistically ? idk. I'm going to go eat.

 OMG I wanna cry what is this **MESS** I just [deployed](https://n-buckley.github.io/travel-tanzania/) it on GitHub pages and for 1 half of my images aren't showing up on google chrome and on safari the css isn't even being applied to them?? cuz they're not scaled at all!! I'm literally so mad idk what to do.

 Ok the safari page and chrome page look the same now, I didn't really change much or anything really. I think it was just glitching... but why aren't my pictures showing up??

 Another thing I've noticed is when I reload the page I can just see "Tanzania" with the shadow before the image loads... I guess is there a way to have a default background? 
 - [x] Look up how to fix this
 -- looks like it was just a [github pages problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60048977/github-pages-images-wont-load-the-server-responded-with-a-404-for-the-image) (both issues the weird css and the images loading) I guess i should have had some more patience ðŸ˜¬

 - [ ] Go back and annotate the page with emojis. Any time you had a big problem ðŸ˜¡ something you learned ðŸ˜¯. Or maybe Ill type an overview/synopsis of my experience about day by day and keep this as authentic as possible

 I just looked at it on mobile... not great. Because I did most of the height sizing based on **vh** and the proportions of a window and a phone window aren't the same,,,, everything is very long.

 I suppose that just means I shouldn't use vh but what should I use ? I'm going to try converting all the vh to vw (and change the sizing) Ok changing it to vw made it more proportional, I do want the hero page to take up the whole front page tho so Ill change that back to vh. But I still don't love it idk if its the spacing or what? maybe the padding should also still be vh?
 
 Also the background image looks horrible its too zoomed in idk why that is? (on mobile).
